## Inspiration
We are all future aspiring entrepeners who recognize the importance of customer 
retention in any business, company, and service. As busnisses strive to create products
and services that draws and keeps customers in, we also wanted to help busnisses
identify characteristics of customers that are at risk of leaving. We ultimately decided
on narrowing our scope to predicting bank churn. We hope that banks and other busninsses
gain valuable insights from our findings.

## What it does
Our bank churn projection model leverages machine learning to predict customer churn, 
helping banks identify at-risk customers before they leave.  By analyzing customer 
demographics (credit score, estimated salary, and more) we are able to provide insights
that drive customer retention strategies.

In the future, we aim to scale our model by leveraging cloud data storage and other deployment tools such as Heroku. We also want to implement batch or real-time processing to make sure our model is continuously trained on the latest data and remains up-to-date.

We also would like to expand beyond the banking sector. Customer retention is crucial for all industries, and we hope to broaden the scope of our model to serve a wider range of use cases.
