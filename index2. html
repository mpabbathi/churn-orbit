      <p> Banks operate millions of customers, each with different circumstances that can lead them to close their accounts and send them towards competitors. Problem

        Understanding why customers leave and what keeps them engaged is essential for long-term success.
        
        In the banking industry, churn is a persistent issue. Customers frequently close their accounts and switch to competitors. This turnover can lead to significant revenue loss for banks.
        To tackle this problem, we analyzed a bank churn dataset. We leveraged machine learning to uncover the most telling predictors of customer retention. Our model provides data-driven insights to help banks proactively address churn and improve customer loyalty.
        Our approach helps banks: Identify at-risk customers. Implement retention strategies based on insights.
